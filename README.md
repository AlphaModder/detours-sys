# detours-sys
This is a set of raw (unsafe) Rust bindings to [Microsoft Detours](https://github.com/Microsoft/Detours). No relation to the [crates.io library currently published under the same name](https://github.com/DianaNites/detours).

## Why make this if there's another library for it already?
I didn't know. Also, we made slightly different design decisons, so I'm not just gonna throw this one away.
